[ ] Replace object list APIs in requests with a cursor-based API for performance reasons
[ ] Review internal implementations of request/filter/etc classes. Copy on write, or shared pointer?
[ ] Replace data storage with something a lot more performant (not a blob object, etc)
[ ] (far future) Rewrite SObject API to work based on 'details' like Contacts instead of QVariant based fields, for performance
[ ] (far future) In an ideal world, seperation of the concept of a local row id (ROWID in sqlite) and SObjectLocalId would be beneficial.
    as-is, for qtcontacts, we're going to have to create an arbitrary field and pretend it's an autoincrement id, which is pretty horrific
